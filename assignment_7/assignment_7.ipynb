    "## Neural Networks: Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will explore Neural Networks; in particular, we are going to explore model complexity. We will use the same dataset from Assignment #6 to classify a mushroom as either edible ('e') or poisonous ('p'). You are free to use PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn -- to name a few resources. The goal is to explore different model complexities (architectures) before declaring a winner. Either start with a simple network and make it more complex; or start with a complex model and pare it down. Either way, your submission should clearly demonstrate your exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output for each model should look like the output of `cross_validate` from Assignment #6:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fold: 0\tTrain Error: 15.38%\tValidation Error: 0.00%\n",
    "Fold: 1\n",

    "\n",
    "Mean(Std. Dev.) over all folds:\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "Train Error: 100.00%(0.00%) Test Error: 100.00%(0.00%)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that \"Test Error\" has been replaced by \"Validation Error.\" Split your dataset into train, test, and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a simple network. Train using the train set. Observe model's performance using the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Increase the complexity of your network. Train using the train set. Observe model's performance using the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model complexity in Assignment #6 was depth limit. You can think of it here as the architecture of the network (number of layers and units per layer). Try at least three different network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We're trying to find a model complexity that generalizes well. (Recall high bias vs high variance discussion in class.)\n",

    "Pick the network architecture that you deem best. Use the test set to report your winning model's performance. This is the ONLY time you use the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Try at least three different models; more importantly, document your process: what the results were, how the winning model was determined, what was the winning model's performance on the test data. Clearly highlight these items to receive full credit."
